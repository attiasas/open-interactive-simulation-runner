## üìö Overview

This project is built on the [LibGdx](https://libgdx.com/) framework and provides the capability to run OIS projects on various platforms. It achieves this by utilizing the [OIS core](https://github.com/attiasas/open-interactive-simulation-core) library, which defines an API for seamless execution of different OIS projects along this project.

To streamline deployment, we've developed the [OIS deployer](https://github.com/attiasas/open-interactive-simulation-deployer) Gradle plugin. This plugin leverages the platform's features to facilitate the deployment of OIS projects on specific platforms based on your requirements by using this project.
